				<p>Constaly.. words spill out of me. When I do work (SCIENTIFIC WORK), I keep a piece of paper at my side and I just write stuff on it nonstop! The stuff isn’t even about science most the time. HOW WILD! So I figure.. I’m gonna take this stuff.. and I’m gonna put it ONLINE. So if you click around on this site at all you’re gonna see the stuff that I think about while I think really hard about something else. The thoughts beneath my other thoughts. OR whatever else I want to put talk about because I can’t be tied down.</p>
