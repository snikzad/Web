			<p>Just a gal ruined by STEM. Usually negative, BUT currently documenting the "advent" of things through hyperlinks with the help of colors that cost money to see....??!!. Could just get a blog but made a website because I chose the wrong major. Theme is brads cause I guess nobody has heard of them, but they are really quite advantageous once you get to know them.. Spent approx ~30 minutes in Michael's this break seaking the Advent of Brads. Later found out my mom had like 500 at home. ANYWHO welcome to my site. Navigate around if you can. Probably gonna move away from the brads motif permanently now. </p>
